> **Brief:**
> To prevent any Disasters, now we have a tool which could instruct us to regulate the damage.
> From a massive Disasters data we could collect significant keys, as Info about disaster, types, Duration, Year, place, with that we would provide a sample data structure, like what kind of Possibilities of high, mid, low destruction, values of those, and processes to generate impact on people, radius,  what prevention shall take by authority,  based on old model.
